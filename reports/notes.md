Differences in levels of gene expression between extant species have accumulated over time through the processes of random genetic drift and natural selection. 

Each gene has an expression optimum, which selection seeks to preserve. Changes that move the population toward this optimum level are selected for, while changes that move the population away from this optimum are selected against.

It has long been accepted that divergence of gene regulation, manifested by phenotypic changes in gene expression, also plays a key role in evolution (King and Wilson 1975; Wang et al. 1996; Pierce and Crawford 1997; Ferea et al. 1999; Fraser et al. 2010)

  34 previously know DE genes, 29 of them are DE in this study, and 28 of 29 have cis-regulation;
  2 of the 5 non-DE genes between parents are also have cis-regulation in F1 , indicating that compensentory cis- and trans- regulatory changes have evolved that maintain gene expression.
  the ratio of species-specific transcripts for 24 genes were examined in recipocal hybrid to ensure the allelic expression was caused by cis-regulatory rather than parent of origin effects, parent-of-origin effects can be neglect.

  The rationale for the hypothesis is that the regulation of gene expression requires the harmonious interaction of trans-regulatory elements (in the simplest case, tran- scription factors) with cis-regulatory elements (in the simplest case, DNA-binding sites for the transcription factors) (e.g., Ptashne and Gann 2002). If natural selec- tion acts to maintain an optimal level of gene expression through time (stabilizing selection), as it appears to (Denver et al. 2005; Lemos et al. 2005), then genetic changes in cis- and trans-regulatory elements that com- pensate each other may accumulate. Consequently, regula- tory elements may diverge genetically between species even though the level of gene expression remains ap- proximately constant. Thermodynamic models that have examined the properties of gene regulatory systems also suggest that similar phenotypes may be covering up ge- netic variation in the underlying regulatory elements and proteins (Gibson 1996; Veitia 2003).
  Compensated cis- and trans-regulatory evolution between species is a mani- festation of a process coined developmental-system drift by True and Haag (2001), through which the pheno- types are evolutionarily maintained despite a turnover of the underlying developmental networks.
  The qua- litative behavior of this model suggests that cis-trans compensatory evolution can lead to misexpression in the hybrid as well as differential allelic expression, a pattern observed for a number of the genes examined experimentally.

  cis-regulatory changes ap- pear to have additive effects on gene expression more often than trans-regulatory changes (Lemos et al. 2008). Such additive alleles affect the phenotype in heterozygous individuals and are thus readily visible to selection. Another example comes from a study of mutation accumulation lines in Caenorhabditis elegans which found that selection in natural populations eliminated most trans-acting mutations that affected expression of many genes. Such a pattern of selection could cause cis-regulatory mutations to accumulate preferentially over time, and cis-regulatory divergence does indeed appear to increase with divergence time (Lemos et al. 2008; Wittkopp et al. 2008).

  However, cis- and trans- regulation have been hypothesized to differ in important genetic and evolutionary properties. First, cis-regulatory variants have been observed to have quantitatively larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory variants (Brem et al. 2002; Hughes et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2011; Gruber et al. 2012), although there are excep- tions (Genissel et al. 2008; Emerson et al. 2010). Second, a greater proportion of cis-regulatory variants have additive effects on ex-pression than trans-acting variants, which are more likely to be dominant or recessive (Wray 2007; Lemos et al. 2008a; McManus et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011; Gruber et al. 2012). Third, cis- regulatory mutations have been hypothesized to have fewer pleio- tropic effects than mutations in transcriptional regulators, which can affect the expression of hundreds of genes (Stern 2000).
  Be- cause additive phenotypic effects increase the efficacy of selection and reduced pleiotropy can decrease deleterious side effects of mutations, it has been proposed that cis-regulatory changes will be enriched between species relative to their frequency within species.

  Allele-specific expression has been used to examine sour- ces of polymorphic and divergent expression genome- wide in flies, yeast, and plants, and these data suggest that trans-acting variation is the predominant source of expression differences among individuals of the same species, whereas cis-regulatory changes play a larger role in expression divergence between individuals of differ- ent species. Genetic mapping of expression differences has thus f
  Genetic mapping of expression differences has thus far been limited to variation within a species, but it also shows an abundance of variants with apparent trans-acting effects on gene expression segregating with- in a species. Both genetic mapping and allele-specific tests show that although cis-regulatory polymorphisms within a species are more rare than trans-regulatory polymorphisms, they tend to have larger effects on ex- pression and are less likely to be recessive than trans- regulatory variants. The additivity of cis-regulatory mu- tations, combined with the expected lower levels of pleiotropy relative to trans-acting mutations, may also make them more likely to contribute to phenotypic evolution.
